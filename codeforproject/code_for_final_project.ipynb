That's one time always is always.  You can call him after dinner but... / That will never happen. / It happens. / Well, he's not president anymore, so why be petty. / Look if the truth is you don't feel like talking about this right now that's fine. But don't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me. Cause there are only so many lies you're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face.

And meatballs.  And you know what? / Not a lot, sweetie.  It's a country. Like Canada.  Only smaller. / You'll be up to your armpits in meatballs, I'm flying them in from Sweden. / Honey, this is Thursday.  I pick you up tomorrow, and we do <u>big</u> spaghetti. / What honey? / Yes...if you like big hair... / People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money. / Ben, mommies work too.  They work very hard.  Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working.  I just don't get paid. / No, that's your fault.  It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority.  Which means, the most important job. / Ben!  Oh my Ben!  Are you alright? / Thank you Ben.  Annabelle! / Seven of clubs.  Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it. / Lava's hateable.  I never thought of that. / I hate snails and blue cheese.

I wouldn't know what to say.  If it were you. / Yeh, better I should forcefeed him burnt lamb and...couscous, was it she made him?  Boy, kids go wild for that. / Never stand between that kid and a meatball. / It's temporary. / Stop.  You're making me insecure. / And we all went through that together? / The great thing about life is that things keep changing. / No.  You think this is going to help the kids then you do it.  You're on your own. / WE are over. / You can't be an 'us' just when you want to.  You can't play that card when it's convenient. / To make it easier for them or you? / Just not to me. / Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago?  The music sounds kind of the same from where I'm sitting. / Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it. / And I'm supposed to care. / <u>Slugs</u>.

She's at my house.  I'll talk to her. / Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up -- / They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father. / We're not discussing your age. / Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age -- / Something's up wi... / Because you don't really seem here. / Are you here? / Remarried.  There is no move. / Just sit me up.  Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first. / Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes. / I have their past. / You'll learn. / You're the hip and fresh. / What do I have that you don't? / Why didn't I? / He only remembers I <u>found</u> him.  My point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing I could ever have done for you. / I was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off.  Doing my imitation of you. / I lost him.  I was panicked. / Come on, a wuss like me?  The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back? / Is scary.  But you want it.  Gimme some truth here. / No, there isn't. / What's this about?  Because we <u>fought</u>? / She likes a Stolie, no ice. / Thanks for coming out. / You've turned her into you.  And I may not get another chance.  To turn her back. / And there will come <u>another</u> moment. When the stakes are <u>really</u> there. And she will look back on this.  And remember how good it felt.  How easy it was. / Well, that's what parenting is <u>about</u>, little girl.  They are <u>pleading</u> to know how they are supposed to do it. And you sure as hell <u>showed</u> her. / Doing the <u>right</u> thing.  Knowing who you <u>are</u>, inside.  Not <u>caving</u> to peer pressure, or <u>lowering</u> yourself to that level, <u>steering</u> your <u>own</u> course... / Shut the fuck up.  <u>I</u> didn't go behind <u>your</u> back. / See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity.  For some <u>real</u> growth. / Well, maybe <u>your</u> version of growing up is 'Just win, baby'. / You think <u>I</u> didn't have some dirty words for that little putz?  You think <u>I</u> couldn't figure out some low blows? / You taught my child that I am some limp dick <u>loser</u>.  Who didn't <u>care</u> about her pain. / So you became the hero.  And I became the schmuck. / You had her <u>lie</u> about that... that fancy-boy <u>model</u>! / You put filth in my child's mouth. / You are <u>defending</u> what you did? / Actually.  They'll want Annabelle's mother. / Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so.  And they'll b... / Now, 'limp dick', I know.  What. Is 'snowballing'? / And I'm going to win. / Now we're going to have a fight, you and I. / He looks familiar.  Did he do a Calvin Klein ad? / Who in the world <u>is</u> he? / Is that what he told you? / Took 28 hours.  She just wasn't sure about entering this world. / Somehow, his blanket always looked like a cape, even the nurse said that.  He <u>loves</u> to hear that story, over and over.  How he was born a magician. / Feeling the pressure? / That's motherhood.  That's the job, with or without a career. I'm telling you the biggest gift you can give them is your happiness. They <u>need</u> you to be happy. / I know you, huh?  The car pools, he measles, the PTA.  It's not gonna be enough for you in the long run.  You have to think long term. / Yes.  I made the choice that was right for me.  And I don't regret it.  But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible.  And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough. / Juggle it!  Move the darkroom into your house.  You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway.  Don't lose your confidence.  Don't lose your edge. / You mean, after I'm dead? / Do what you've worked your whole life to do? / I'm thinking.  Do I know you well enough to really chew you out? / ...go to the park.  In the worst way. / It's <u>covered</u>, okay?  I appreciate your concern.  Can I talk to her? / Thanks, but it's under control. / How's she doing with Brad? / Eat your heart out.  Is Annabelle there? / What else?  Keep on keepin' on. / He's relentless.  A <u>major</u> asshole. / The primo stuff is great for pain. / You try to center on the big issues, y'know.  What it's all about.  What this whole trip has meant.  But then, the <u>really</u> big issues keep swamping y... / Yeh, that's bull.  I'm going for serene, they say some actually get there. / I really look like shit. / It's promising, this one.  We're upbeat. / It's a mess, right now.  That's my project when I get back. / And you said...? / She's devastated. / Oh, my God. / ...going out, yeh.  I had kids of my own, once. / Moi? / She hasn't mentioned this. / You're a cross-dresser. / Small world. / Ironic, huh? / I have given them more<u>love</u> and more <u>care</u> every fifteen <u>minutes</u> of their lives, than you could manage in the next fifty <u>years</u>! / They came out of my <u>body</u>! / You are <u>marrying</u> the <u>greatest</u> guy who walks this <u>earth</u>.  Who I have <u>loved</u> from my <u>heart</u> for twelve<u>years</u>! / How would you know <u>anything</u>? / How the hell would you know? / Life's a trade-off.  You get cancer, your hair falls out, but you <u>do</u> get to smoke dope. / Really.  By what right?  Six months of part-time screw-ups? / Then let him talks to me.  We don't need you to solve our prob... / Did I hear the word... / Bi-coastal parenting.  Happens every day.  Luke gets the kids every other summer, every other holiday, it's not ideal, but people make it work, and... / Nobody likes a snoop. / Don't flatter yourself. / You WHAT? / My boss. / I don't know wh... / Let's...hold up for a bit.  It may not happen.  Our secret, okay? / ...make some trips into the city. Sometimes, overnight. / ...thinking of going back to Random House.  On a part-time basis. / Not great.  Plus, I've got things on my mind.  You know. / Yes? / She was angry at herself. / Anxiety. / Hey.  At least it's not an editing machine. / It's okay, it's twenty minutes.  The horse'll be there. / Do you have a word limit you need to hit every day or can I finish? / Ben likes to be read to.  Do you know Dr. Seuss...? / Bandaids for cuts.  Bandaids for new shoe blisters.  Packet of Wash n Dri's. Kleenex.  Sugar free lollipops, potty seat covers for public restrooms... / Fine, forget it. / However many.  It's not enough. / I have an appointment this after- noon.  I need someone to take them to the park. / So why did y... / Those are <u>my</u> children you're practicing on.  They deserve <u>first-</u> rate care.  Every minute.  Of every night.  And every day. / You're not terribly good at taking care of h... / I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite... / I'm sorry.  Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but... / A court <u>order</u> is gonna say that <u>woman</u> is <u>never</u> <u>alone</u> with my children!  Ever <u>again</u>!  Do you HEAR that? / I am not <u>here</u> to make it easier for you.  These are <u>my</u> children.  They don't want to <u>be</u> with you. / You listen carefully because I am only going to say this once.  That woman has nothing more to do with my children. / Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now. / Think twice.  Before you <u>ever</u> pull that again. / Of all the <u>cheap</u> excuses.  To break a child's heart. / Machines do not EAT message. / You got to hell! / Get out! / Oh and I don't because I have a children?! The problem is you're too self-involved to ever be a mother. / You mean for you.  A 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family.  She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. And you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen?  This isn't going to work out. / Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards? / I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers. / ...a ridiculously <u>expensive</u> and <u>inappropriate</u> item, which her father and I have already <u>told</u> her she is <u>far</u> too young to own.  But <u>you</u> apparently want to <u>buy</u> her forgiveness, with... / What did you do? / What happened with Annabelle?  Has nothing I said gotten through to you? / Annabelle, how's your video rep... / We don't have any coffee. / Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday.  It's not that hard.  Didn't you have a mother? / How do you hold down a job?  It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",

But it takes time. / Soon. / You give me hope, John. / Do you love her? / Good news? / For you. / Oh yes, I think so. / We should construct thorn fences around every tent area. Fires burning at night. / You don't know what Tsavo means, do you?  It means \"slaughter\"... / You- they cannot believe you're still here. / I am also liaison between these two. / Did it look like this in your mind? / Get on? They detest each other. Obviously the Africans hate the Indians. But the Indians also hate the other Indians. Some of them worship cows, while others eat them. / Thank you. The truth is this: you have to work at it constantly. / Because they are here.  Because Tsavo is the worst place in the world.  Come, John- to the bridge. / Some mysteries should not have solutions. / Help finish the railroad. / Where do you go next? / And where will you sleep beautifully? / Did you ever see a lion that size?

       "That was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me. / I'll be in the bedroom. / Where are the kids? / Please don't leave me. / I never asked for more. / You live a fabulous life, Robin. / I always felt I could never marry you without first showing you what a fabulous life you cloud live despite me. / That sounds pathetic, doesn't it? / I was talking about our marriage. / So am I, Robin.  I'm working at something, too.  I'm even talking.  Do you want to be around for it? / You can't go with me because of Sam? / You can't go because of Sam? / Good.  That was the plan.

Or we can pawn them off on your parents. / Sooner than the Fall. / Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative? / We should take a vacation. / I'd be you. / If I let everything that should worry me, worry me, I'd be dead from worry. / Should I? / Is Lois still here?

       "I think one of you has been part and parcel of making this situation! / Didn't catch his or her name, just followed them down here. Somebody all in white surgical gown. / Running all the bells and whistles we set up to scare hell out of everybody -- / Upstairs, too. Come with me, I'll show you another body, a friend of mine named Schecter -- / -- she's not dead! Just have to get her heart pumping aqain! / Where is it?? / Can't imagine by who. I don't suppose the truth would interest you: that I've never had another wife but Evelyn. / Excuse me? / Even if I were inclined, I've had better -- and a lot safer -- opportunities to kill off a wife. / What? / Melissa! / Well, until that's found, I think it's a good idea we all stick together.  Or wouldn't that fit into your plans, baby? / -- I'm sure you did. / You're not my list. / Just for the record: what are the rest of your names? / A very, very scary game. But then look at the bright side: if there's only one of you still upright at dawn, you'll be leaving here with five million dollars in your pocket. / Pritchett, you're not joining this necktie party? / -- yeah, we did that -- / Adrenaline -- in your bag, Blackburn, you must have -- / Prove it how? / Married. Once. Same woman. All these years. She just slithered up the stairs. / Evelyn, could you just zip it for a moment? It looks like we're stuck here 'til morning -- let's make the best of it. / I'll meet you down there. / Yeah. But, hey, anybody who's not \"comfortable\" with the rules, you're free to walk, anytime. Seven digits poorer, goes without saying. / The second the sun hits tomorrow morning. Assuming you have stayed the entire night - and you're still alive, of course. Any other questions? / Right here, Mr. Pritchett. As well as five other bona fide, bank drafts for one million dollars each. Made out to cash. / Evelyn... Get up... NOW! / No... / -- witnesses to what? You're already dead, Evelyn! Happy Birthday, baby -- / -- just what you wanted everyone here to believe in the first place: I'm going to murder you, Evelyn, with the greatest of pleasure -- / -- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak -- / They weren't loaded when I put them in there! / Jesus! / -- that wasn't my original plan, but it is starting to look more attractive -- / If I had one, Evelyn, I think you know who'd be first and last -- / -- I pose you the same question -- / Asking the wrong person again. / Where is she? / A simple leak, if it's okay with you. / Only one way I can think of, Sweetheart. / What are you talking about? / -- in the act. / Oh, no-no-no -- much more bang for everyone's buck to nail the bitch -- / Huh. And here I had a completely different theory. / -- asking the wrong guy -- wasn't me who closed it. / Now, there's the simple country gal I married. Let's go back down and greet your guests -- show them the real you: corny as Kansas on the Fourth of July. / I know. / -- just not always in the sexual sense. / You know everything you do gets me hot. / You know how happy I'd be if that was really true, Evelyn? And how positively goddamn delirious if you weren't fucking every living thing in our area code at the same goddamn time! / Finding ways for me to die at these things is really your deal, isn't it? The \"O.J.\" knife with the not-quite- retractable blade? Your \"Jim Jones Kool- Aid\" that was exactly that? / Sure know it wasn't me. And if you say it wasn't you -- then who the hell did, Evelyn? / You tell me. I don't know how you managed to hack into my Mac, but: bravo. / Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited. / Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers. / Oh, I think we're going to have several. / You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.  And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin! / I'm impressed: I don't think Evelyn's ever said those words to anything with genitalia. / -- forget it. Last birthday the Manson Family Ranch, the year before that: Jonestown. / Maybe if I -- / Like what?? This isn't supposed to be happening!! / I've designed and built six of these places -- take my word for it, everything's fine. / I wouldn't be opening this place tomorrow if every single thing down to the beheaded Beanie Babies hadn't tested 100% safe. / I think it's something better experienced then described. / Ever seen one that starts at the top? 20 stories worth of top? / Absolutely. No cheap thrills. A genuine Journey To The Brink Of Madness. / My wife. Where were we? / He was right! Pritchett was right! / Or somebody wanting me to believe that. / Thank God -- I was afraid I'd be lynched without a quorum. / I think, Pritchett, we've got a situation here that even you can't explain away as \"ghosts.\" This is ice- cold homicide by person -- or persons -- / What? / Must be those plates -- interfering with the signal somehow. / -- even if I give you a million as well? / I think you're gonna miss the bash of a lifetime -- / Sorry, Pritchett, here you go. / Alright, Mr. Pritchett, let me just sign the damn thing. / She's been marked for it. The House does that. Happened to Pritchett's father. Likely happen to you all. Isn't that what you told me, Mr. Pritchett? / Please! I need your help. / Then tell me, please -- help me...! / -- listen to me, goddamnit -- / -- I'll take the chance, come morning and cops, I'll be proved right -- / Don't test me, I'm real prepared to use this to stay alive -- / Well, I can't, sweetheart. / Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the \"Saturation Chamber.\" / I was chasing after somebody I saw in the salon. / Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement? / I was upstairs! / -- no -- that's when everything went ragtime -- whoever else is in this house has been doing everything since -- I thought it was Evelyn -- / I think I'll do what I damn well please. / Something with the power, I don't know!! / I'll try not to remember to warn Evelyn. / Sorry. / -- I wouldn't worry, Ms. Jenzen: the unexplainable will probably explain herself before too long. In the meantime, let's all relax, have a drink, the evening's young -- / Very good. Well, I think I can say with complete honesty: I've never heard of any of you. / Oh, sorry. Detail I guess I forgot to mention. You die, you lose. Your check gets divvied-up by those still amongst the living. / You're forgetting my lovely wife; she's part of the same winner-take-all as the rest of you. / Don't take your eyes off her for a second. I think she just declared War. / No. Somehow -- I don't know how -- she did it. / It works. / Then who did?? / Rewind that. / I mean, not that it didn't give Evelyn the kind of coronary I had in mind, just... / -- hey! Next time give me a couple seconds notice before you wing a gag like that! / So disengage his Flail Arm Mechanism and just make him a screamer. / Problem where? Looked good to me. / Evelyn, go stir your cauldron or something for a sec.

       "Rick, hide me. Do something! You must help me, Rick. Do something! / Rick! Rick, help me! / Don't be afraid of that. Please keep them for me. Thank you. I knew I could trust you. / Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer. / One moment. Tonight I'll be selling those for more money than even I have ever dreamed of, and then, addio Casablanca! You know, Rick, I have many friends in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me you're the only one I trust. Will you keep these for me? Please. / Myself. I found myself much more reasonable. / Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca. / But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic? / But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas. / I forgot. You never drink with...  I'll have another, please.  You despise me, don't you? / Thank you.

       "Oh, I didn't know that. / I think it's in New Jersey. / It's in New Jersey. / Saddle River's in New Jersey. / That would be a pity because you're a real painter. / Bruno called. In Europe, people are saying you're gonna die from drugs. They think they can cash in on your death. / Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you. / That was my favorite part! / I don't like beer. / I wanted to make a few more of these. Frank's been drinking this Mexican beer. It makes a good green. / I'm going to send them to my friends for Christmas presents. / Well, have you asked her to come back? / Do you still love her? / What's wrong? / Let's go to the Carnegie Museum. They have the world's most famous sculptures all in these giant plaster replicas. It's really great. It's in Pittsburg. / My dog, Archie... I woke up with flea bites... Creepy. I ran out and bought flea collars. They work really well. / Gee. I don't need to. You're a natural. You should sign up with my modeling agent. / Wow... Stop giving them away.  I got an invitation to model for Comme de Garcons... You wanna do it with me? / That's good. At least they're interested. / Jean Michel, this is Mary Boone. She's got the great new gallery. / My jacket? Gee, great...  Your show looks great. Quite a turnout. You look great. You kids. You drink red wine with fish. You can do anything! Make paintings in the basement of your gallery? First time I've heard of that! / I can give you five. You didn't do very much to these. / Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good. / Ignorant art?

       "Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow... / When you die...be sure your brain is the last organ to fizzle -- / I can undress myself, thank you. / Pray you, undo this button. / Nothing I didn't deserve. / Oh Clayton. / No, I don't want to die alone.  But to be killed by you -- that would make death bearable.  They say you never see the one with your name on it.  But I want to see death coming at me.  I want it to be sharp and hard, with a human face.  Your face.  Think, Clayton.  You'd be my second Monster.  Almost as famous as the first.  It would be the great adventure you've yearned for. A war story for both of us to share. / Break my neck.  Or strangle me.  It would be oh so easy to wrap your hands around my neck and choke the life out of me.  Please, Clayton. We've come this far. / Oh, but you have.  You undressed for me.  I kissed you.  I even touched your prick.  How will you be able to live with yourself? / Wait until I tell my friends I had you naked in my arms.  Won't they be surprised? / Oh, but you feel good, Clayton. / Relax, Clayton.  I can't hear you. I can't hear a word. / What was that? / There are straps in back. / Please, Clayton.  Just for a minute.  Long enough for me to see the effect. / For the artistic effect.  The combination of your human body and that inhuman mask.  It's quite striking. / Don't move. / You are much too human. / No.  It won't do. / So it is going to happen after all. / Oh no, my friend.  It's digging itself up.  There is nothing in the here and now to take my mind off it.  All my diversions have abandoned me.  Parties.  Reading. Painting.  Work.  Love.  All gone to me now. / Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling? Grave where thy victory? / Barnett.  Barnett on the wire. / Oh, but it does.  Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make. / I don't recall.  Memories of the war, perhaps. / I don't remember that one. / \"A perfect night for mystery and horror.  The air itself is filled with monsters.\" / Not at all. / That's where you're wrong, Clayton. You've just told one.  A very good story indeed. / I'm very sorry. / What happened? / Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake? / A very lucky thing indeed. / The Great War? / I see. / But you said -- / Come now.  I'm sure you came across such situations in Korea.  A wounded comrade, or perhaps one of the enemy?  Someone for whom death would be a blessing. / Tell me something, Clayton.  Do you believe in mercy killing? / I'd like to try again.  If you're game. / After dinner, if Hanna isn't back? Can we try a few more sketches? / The only memento I ever kept.  My original sketch for the Monster. / Very sporting of you, Clayton. / Sorry.  My pajamas are tailored. Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel?  No more immodest than a kilt, you know. / That only leaves the rest. / You're much wider than I am.  You won't want to attempt to get into my pants. / I'm afraid not.  Terribly sorry.  I believe I promised you some clothes. / Oh, of course.  Clayton.  You finished your shower already? / Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man? / It's not like her. / Catch my death. / We're not sugar.  We won't melt. / Let's get out of this funk hole / Run for what? / Monsters?  The only monsters...  ...are here. / Neither of us really belongs here. / Are you enjoying yourself? / David produced her last picture. / Girl?  Oh.  Elizabeth Taylor. / David.  The friend I thought was in New York. / Nothing of importance.  Just two old men slapping each other with lilies.  Shall we have a drink? / Exactly.  Cukor was too cheap to hire music.  There's nothing but chin-wag.  The cold dreary custard of English chin-wag. / What did I tell you?  Listen. / Nothing would please me more. / I suppose you'd like the top down. / Good afternoon, Clayton. / Very good, Clayton.  May I call you Clayton?  Or do you prefer Boone? / If you don't mind driving, I'd like to take you as my guest.  There should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you amused. / It was foolishness to attempt this portrait.  You cannot force what will not flow. / My apologies.  I had no business snapping at you. / I want -- I want... / Just go.  Please.  Why don't you go? / Of course I remember.  Do you think I'm so senile -- / You're very clever, Mr. Boone.  You just sit there and let me talk. What a sorry old man, you're thinking.  What a crazy old poof.  Why are you here?  What do you want from me? / Why do I tell you this?  I never told David.  I never even remembered it until you got me going. / You will not set me on another walk down memory lane.  Not this lane. Not today. / Barnett.  Was that his name? Leonard Barnett.  He came to the front straight from Harrow.  And he looked up to me.  Unlike the others, he didn't care that I was a workingman impersonating his betters.  How strange, to be admired so blindly.  I suppose he loved me.  But chastely, like a schoolboy. / No, my dear.  The Crimean War. What do you think?  The Great War. You had a Good War, while we had -- / I was an officer. / Not at all.  I was in the foxholes myself. / Oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers. / No teammates in football?  No comrades in Korea? / Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us.  Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion? / And the fear you showed at our last session?  How did you overcome that? / What about your stint in Korea? I'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes. / Everybody has stories to tell. / I'm curious, Mr. Boone.  What convinced you to come back? / Mr. Boone.  You're not due to cut the lawn until Wednesday. / Oh no.  I never swim. / The extras are in their places. Now we need the star.  Wouldn't you like to get in the pool? / I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no -- / Of course, they weren't nearly as bashful.  No, this room was once filled with bare buttocks.  And pricks.  Hard, arrogant pricks -- / Twenty years.  Too long.  We were like a play whose run outlasted the cast's ability to keep it fresh. So I finally decided to close down the show. / But I chose freedom.  David was still in the thick of it, his life full of anxiety and studio intrigue.  I didn't fancy spending my golden years as merely \"the friend.\"  The dirty little secret of a nervous producer. / Better work. / I think we all want to feel we've left our mark on the world.  Yes. I wish I had done more work. / It's so far in the past now.  Over fifteen years -- / After that, I went out of fashion. I was no longer able to command the best projects, so I walked away.  Why should I spend my time working in such a dreadful business? / The fucking studio butchered it. It was 1937, Hitler's armies were already massing -- and still the New York bankers stood in line to curry his favor.  Anything to avoid losing the German market.  They cut away the guts and brought in another director to add slapstick. The picture laid an egg, a great expensive bomb.  For which I was blamed. / You might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when I was at the very pinnacle of my profession.  The horror movies were behind me.  I'd done \"Show Boat.\" Major success.  Great box office. Now I was to do something important.  \"The Road Back.\"  An indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany.  It was to be my masterpiece. / In a way, yes.  I suppose so.  I know it's why I stopped making pictures. / I like that.  But take care, Mr. Boone.  Freedom is a drug, much like any other.  Too much can be a very bad thing. / Ah.  A philosopher. / Very well put. / Why not? / Tell me more about yourself, Mr. Boone.  You have a steady companion? / Of course.  I don't want to scare you off.  Not before I'm finished with you. / Suppose we unbutton the top and pull it down around your shoulders? Two buttons.  Is that so much to ask?  Just two little buttons. / Oh dear.  I <u>have</u> made you nervous. / But we have to match the other sketch. / It will only make you self-conscious.  You'll have to remove your shirt. / I hope this has nothing to do with your refusing to sit for me today? / So we understand each other? / Don't be ridiculous.  I know a real man like you would break my neck if I so much as laid a hand on him. Besides, you're not my type. / What way might that be? / I never thought you were. / Oh dear.  If one must have a clinical name. / Does that surprise you? / Or a husband.  Depending on which of us you asked.  My friend David. He lived here for many years. / No.  At least not in the legal sense. / Just a trim.  And mine while you're at it.  Fingers are a bit stiff today. / All righty.  I understand. / I'll pay our going rate.  Plus what you'd get if you did the hedges. / What is we say phooey to the hedges?  Could you spare an hour after lunch?  To sit for me? / Yes, I believe you could.  How free is your schedule this afternoon? / Quite true.  Hand-to-hand combat is the true test.  Did you ever slay anyone hand-to-hand? / It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of. / Did you kill anyone? / Of course.  I had to make it interesting for myself, you see.  A comedy about death.  The trick is not to ruin it for anyone who isn't in on the joke.  But the Monster never receives any of my gibes.  He is noble.  Noble and misunderstood. / Pity.  People are so earnest nowadays. / Did anyone laugh? / Did you now? / Yes.  An old, useless friend.  You must excuse me, Mr. Boone.  This is a world I finished with long ago. I pay them no mind and expect them to return the compliment.  Lunch should be ready.  Shall we? / Is this David's doing? / Do you mind? / I assume you worked up an appetite with your labor. / How are you, Mr. Boone?  So glad you are free for lunch. / You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia. / In Dudley there were more sides of the tracks than any American can imagine.  Every Englishman knows his place.  And if you forget, there's always someone to remind you.  My family had no doubts about who they were.  But I was an aberration in that household a freak of nature.  I had imagination, cleverness, joy.  Where did I get that?  Certainly not from them. / No, you were middle class, like all Americans. / There's something about the openness of your face that makes me want to speak the truth.  Yes, my family ate dripping.  Beef dripping and four to a bed, and a privy out back in the alley.  Are you also from the slums, Mr. Boone? / I've spent most of my life outrunning my past.  Now it's flooding all over me. / I'm sorry.  I've just realized how terribly ironic it all is. / Of course not.  As I said, only poor people -- / It is.  Only the poorest families ever ate it.  We kept ours in a crockery jar. / Dripping?  Do you ever eat dripping in this country?  The fat from roasts and such, congealed in jars.  Used like butter on bread. / It's a bit like being at the doctor, isn't it?  You have to remain perfectly still while I examine and scrutinize you. / Would you be more comfortable barefoot?  Feel free to remove your boots and socks. / That's exactly what I intend to do. / We could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders.  Would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness? / Oh if it's going to make you uncomfortable...  Perhaps we can find something else for you to wear. / Pish posh, Mr. Boone.  I'm not your Aunt Tilly. / I'm sorry.  It's too white, too distracting.  Would it be asking too much for you to take it off? / That shirt, Mr. Boone. / Hmmm.  I much prefer \"Show Boat\" or \"The Invisible Man.\"  Shall we begin? / You don't say?  Which picture? / Excellent.  We'll have a most interesting time. / I have no interest in your body, Mr. Boone.  I can assure you of that. / What are you suggesting?  You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder. / Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him. / Indeed.  I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head. / I apologize for going on like this. It's the Sunday painter in me.  Of course I can understand your refusal.  It's a great deal to ask of someone. / Yes.  You were a Marine. / You went to university? / But expressively broken.  How did it happen? / You have the most architectural skull.  And your nose.  Very expressive. / Sat for an artist.  Been sketched. / To an artistic eye, you understand. Have you ever modeled? / You must excuse me for staring, Mr. Boone.  But you have a marvelous head. / Nothing serious.  A touch of stroke. / I returned recently from a stay in hospital. / When they stay in your employ too long, servants begin to think they're married to you.  Please, Mr. Boone.  Help yourself. / Merely comfortable.  Here's Hanna with our refreshments.  Can you get the door? / I made only the first two.  The others were done by hacks. / This and that.  The only ones you maybe have heard of are the \"Frankenstein\" pictures. / In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood.  No, I was merely a director here. / But before I retired, you might say I had a brief time in the sun. Fame, as it were.  Tell me, do you like motion pictures? / They were familiar when I painted them.  That one's copied from a Dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago.  And that's a Rembrandt. / You know what they say.  If you have to ask -- / What?  Oh yes. / Splendid. / Or would you prefer a beer? / The honest sweat of one's brow.  I assure you I won't be offended. Let me tell Hanna to bring tea for two. / I was just about to ask Hanna to bring down iced tea.  I'd like it very much if you'd join me. / Everything alright, Mr. Boone? / Getting to be a warm day.  A scorcher, as you Yanks call it. / The Marines.  Good for you.  You must have served in Korea. / I couldn't help but notice your tattoo.  That phrase?  Death Before Dishonor.  What does it mean? / And your name is --? / My name is Whale.  This is my house. / Good morning. / Yes.  Perfectly. / Then who did? / No.  I never could.  You must regret having had the invitation sent. / But I have no reputation.  I'm as free as the air. / Oh dear.  I'll never work in this town again? / I did.  But Princess Margaret was a doll.  We're all equals in her eyes.  As commoners, I presume. / You should have seen Georgie's face when he met Clayton. / Oh, David, stop being a nanny. / Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York. / Thank you. / Oh, David.  There's no pleasure in making you feel guilty.  You better go, my boy.  You'll be late for that aeroplane. / \"The fault, dear David, is not in ourselves but in our stars.\" / I wanted to be alert for your visit today.  Especially since I saw so little of you in the hospital. / It's the ridiculous pills they prescribe.  If I take them, I spend the next day stupid as a stone. If I don't, my mind seems to go off in a hundred directions at once -- / You seem to be saying that this isn't just a case of resting until I'm better.  That my condition will continue to deteriorate until the end of my life. / So what do I do? / But the rest of it?  The killing headaches.  The phantom smells.  My inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once. It's all nothing more than bad electricity? / You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head? / Yes, yes, Dr. Payne.  But from the neck up?  What's my story there? / Good-bye.  So nice to see you... / Oh dear. / Of course. / Perfectly all right.  But if you'd like to sit -- / But you appear quite fresh, my dear. / Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old. / Elsa? / Nonsense, my dear.  You look extraordinary.  Today's script.  Quick.  And a pencil. / Bring a mirror.  Let the Bride feast upon her visage. / I'll be out this afternoon, remember?  Your family can visit as long as they like. / It needs a hat.  There was a wide-brimmed cream fedora... / Of course.  How is the old boy these days? / Do you miss having someone to talk to, Hanna? / I'd hardly call our yardman a friend. / Who was that at the door? / Does the yardman come today? / I'll be fine, Hanna.  Thank you. / She is beautiful. / No, Hanna.  My heart isn't that black. / Don't be silly, Hanna.  He's a very proper actor.  And the dullest fellow imaginable. / Go. / Just go.  We can manage without you. / Yes, yes, yes.  I merely invited Mr. Boone in for a glass of tea. We'll have a brief chat and he'll finish the yard. / My mind's lovely.  And yours? / No.  Let me lie here.  Thank you. / Oh shut up.  All we did was talk. My attack had nothing to do with him. / You must think I'm terrible, Hanna. / Luminal. / Yes? / Don't be daft.  It's just a student from the university. / There is iced tea, Hanna?  Cucumber sandwiches? / Hanna?  Who's the new yardman? / My monsters? / I commend you.  If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you.  You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs. / You, Mr. Kay?  How do you know George Cukor? / You didn't? / Mr....Kay? / I'm sorry I spoiled it for you. You should probably go home. / Head.  Not heart. / I just need to -- lie down. Studio.  Daybed in studio. / You think so?  That's very kind -- / My idea.  Muchly.  My sketches. Big heavy brow.  Head flat on top so they could take out the old brain and put in the new, like tinned beef. / Universal wanted me for another story, and wanted me so baldly -- I mean badly, not baldly.  I was given the pick of stories being developed, and I picked that one. / Righto.  Let me see. / Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through.  I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste. / Of course. / Certainly, Mr. Kay.  Is there anything in particular you want to know? / Don't be shy.  There's time to stop before you go too far. / Take off your vest and I'll tell you a story. / You must understand how Hollywood was twenty years ago.  Nobody cared a tinker's cuss who slept with whom, so long as you kept it out of the papers.  Outside of Hollywood, who knows who George Cukor is, much less what he does with those boys from the malt shops along Santa Monica? / A homosexual scandal, you mean? For me to answer a question of that magnitude, you'll have to remove both your shoes and your socks. / What rumors might those be? / Quite. / It is, isn't it?  My life as a game of strip poker.  Shall we play? / Let's make it more interesting.  I will answer any question you ask. But, for each answer, you must remove one article of clothing. / I have a proposal, Mr. Kay.  This mode of questioning is getting old, don't you think? / I am not dead yet, Mr. Kay. / Twenty-one.  The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking.  The horror pictures were trifles.  Grand guignol for the masses. / Am I correct in assuming, Mr. Kay, that it's not me you're interested in, only my horror pictures? / There was one play in particular, a beautiful, grim study of war called \"Journey's End\".  Every experienced director turned it down, so I offered myself, bullying and begging for the job.  \"Journey's End\" made the careers of everyone associated with it.  It was only a matter of time until Hollywood beckoned. / Of course.  I attended Eton -- it wouldn't do for a master's son to attend where his father taught.  I was to go up to Oxford but the war broke out and I never made it.  The Great War, you know.  You had a Good War, but we had a great one. / Yes? / I was born outside London, the only son of a minister who was a master at Harrow.  Grandfather was a bishop.  Church of...Church of Eng... / So, Mr. Kay?  What do you want to know? / This is the studio where I paint. / After you then. / Will that be good for you, Mr. Kay? / Is it now?  Hanna?  I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool. / One likes to live simply. / No.  I expect you can't. / Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine.  James Whale. / Sit? / Fine.  Quite fine.  And Your Royal Highness?    1\n",
       "Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man. / Jack, I was just trying to help. / Does everybody have to hear? / Please don't shout. / You have four seasons, you have four slumps. / A new car. We can't afford a new car. / Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little lightheaded. / Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it? Like leotards. / What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married. / What does Charlie think about that? / You know, dear, I think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. Just tell us. We'll believe you. / Isn't that awfully forward? / Would they go over my girdle or under? / I'm not the maid! / Where have you been? / You accepted an invitation, Maddy's one of your best friends, and I baked the Rice Krispie squares. / Maddy's party. / Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready? / Peggy, do you know what a penis is?  Stay away from it. / Is Charlie pressuring you to do things you don't think you should be doing? / That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning. / Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter. / Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are. / What happened to you? / Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it? / Would you get that, dear? / It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today? / What about? / What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?. / When did you start drinking coffee? / You're looking pretty chipper this morning. / What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up? / My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast. / Of course, dear. You're home now. / Why don't you go lie down for a while. / How do you feel? / The nurse called and said you'd be coming home.
