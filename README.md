# Final Project IS 417

My project is looking at if action movies have become more popular than comedy movies. I will be doing this by looking at a movie dialogue dataset. I have set up a text modeling algorithm. I then went through the lines and counted the number of comedy characters and action characters by labeling them as either 0 or 1. How I will interpret this is if their is more comedy characters than action then I will know comedy is still more popular. I will be splitting the dataset into two different parts, movies before 1990 and movies after 1990. So, if there are more comedy charcters after 1990 than action I will know it is more popular. I'm also going to look at the intersection to be able to show if the intersection between action and comedy movies changes after 1990.
